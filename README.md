## üìö Project Overview

**DT Money** is a financial control application designed to help you manage your finances, tracking your inflows and outflows and calculating the total balance.

This project is developed as part of the third module of the React course on the Rocketseat platform, focusing on API consumption and performance optimization.

## üåü Features

- üì• **Add Entries and Exits**: Easily track your financial transactions.
- üí∞ **Total Calculation**: Automatically calculates and displays your total balance.
- üöÄ **Performance Optimizations**: Utilizes advanced React features for optimal performance.

## üõ† Tools and Technologies

### Core Technologies

- **[React](https://reactjs.org/)**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)**: A fast front-end build tool and development server.
- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**: A strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, providing better tooling at any scale.

### Styling

- **[Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)**: Allows you to use component-level styles in your application, helping to manage and scope your styles.

### Icons

- **[Phosphor React](https://phosphoricons.com/)**: A flexible icon library for React applications.

### Accessibility

- **[Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/)**: Provides a set of accessible and unstyled UI components:
  - **[@radix-ui/react-radio-group](https://www.radix-ui.com/docs/primitives/components/radio-group)**: For creating accessible radio groups.
  - **[@radix-ui/react-dialog](https://www.radix-ui.com/docs/primitives/components/dialog)**: For creating accessible modal dialogs.

### Backend Simulation

- **[JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server)**: A tool for creating a full fake REST API that simulates a backend server.

### HTTP Client

- **[Axios](https://axios-http.com/)**: A promise-based HTTP client for making HTTP requests, which simplifies the process of interacting with APIs.

### Form Management

- **[React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/)**: A library that helps with managing form state and validation efficiently.
- **[Controlled](https://react-hook-form.com/api/usecontroller/controller)**: Adapts non-native HTML elements in forms to behave like inputs without submitting forms.
- **[@hookform/resolvers](https://react-hook-form.com/api/usecontroller/resolvers)**: Integrates validation libraries with React Hook Form.
- **[Zod](https://zod.dev/)**: A TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library used with React Hook Form for form validation.

### State Management and Optimization

- **[useContextSelector](https://github.com/dai-shi/use-context-selector)**: Optimized context selector for avoiding unnecessary renders.
- **[Scheduler](https://reactjs.org/docs/concurrent-mode-suspense.html#scheduling-prioritized-updates)**: An API for scheduling work.
- **React Hooks**:
  - **[useState](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html)**: Manages state in functional components.
  - **[useEffect](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html)**: Handles side effects in functional components.
  - **[useReducer](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usereducer)**: Manages complex state logic.
  - **[useCallback](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usecallback)**: Returns a memoized callback function.
  - **[useMemo](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usememo)**: Returns a memoized value.
  - **[memo](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactmemo)**: Optimizes functional components by memoizing the result.

### Performance and Optimization

- **Reducer Method**: Used to summarize entries and exits, providing an efficient way to manage complex state logic.
- **Memoization**: Techniques like `useCallback`, `useMemo`, and `memo` are used to optimize rendering and improve performance.
- 
- ### DevTools
  - **[React Developer Tools](https://reactjs.org/blog/2019/08/15/new-react-devtools.html)**: A set of tools that allow you to inspect the React component hierarchy, view props and state, and analyze performance.
